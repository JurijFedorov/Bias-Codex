# Bias-Codex
Bias Codex made concurrent with psychology

I applied more "proper" evolutionary psychology to the model as he made it super accecible
and therefore used layman explanations instead of academic terms.

All these people did an amazing job! It's by far the best bias list I have seen anywhere and there is nothing even close to it.
