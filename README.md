# Bias-Codex

I applied more "proper" evolutionary psychology to the model as he made it super accecible
and therefore used layman explanations instead of academic terms.

Biases are often instincts that then cause a bias because they are made to calculate things
and apply solutions a certain way. So a bias for carring for a son is making you save him over a random person. 
This is "irrational" compared to what a cold robot would do. But it's still solving a problem well and making
sure your genes can reproduce effectively.

Seeing biases as problems is the wrong way to look at things. Seeing them as not objective is correct.




All these people did an amazing job! It's by far the best bias list I have seen anywhere and there is nothing even close to it.
